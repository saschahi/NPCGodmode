This Mod can make Town NPCs of your choosing invulnerable!

Go into "YOURUSERFOLDER\Dokuments\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Configs"
and open "NPC Control.json" with a Texteditor of your Choice to Configure this mod.

If you choose to add more mods, this mod will automatically put the new Town-NPCs into the config-list.

And don't worry. the Config won't break if you remove a Mod that adds a Town-NPC

ToDo:
- Add an on/off Switch for NPC-Invulnerability ingame somehow (maybe work with HEROsMod)
- Tidy up code and Put some Failsafes in

V0.1
- Make the Mod Operable
- Add the Guide and the Clothier as exceptions

V0.2.0
- Made the Mod Actually make the NPCs invincible (for some reason it only made their HP bar disappear before)
- There is now a config to activate/deactivate invincibility for each TownNPC
- Made it 95% compatible with other mods and their Town NPCs! (tested with a few, it's possible some mods can break this mod)
